# Components React JS 

This is a simple task from the DevQuest React Basics course where I needed to create two components: Paragraph and Button.

- The Paragraph component contains a function that returns 3 < p > tags, which receive props for color and uppercase.

- The Button component contains a function that returns an ALERT stating the button's label, and another function with an onClick event that triggers the ALERT function when the button is clicked.

In this task, I deepened my understanding of creating components, props (properties), and JavaScript functions.
